# US Superstore python project

## A fully functional sample project written in python to showcase data cleaning and visualization of a retail store

US Superstore aims to enhance operations and boost profits. To reach this aim, the organisation must use its extensive data collection over time. The challenge is to use data analysis and statistical methods to provide actionable insights for firm management.

How can US Superstore improve operations and increase profits by analysing previous sales and customer data?


## Steps taken

* I imported all necessary libraries
* Data inspection: This was carried out to know data quality 
* Data cleaning: Filled empty cells, removed duplicates, changed data types of some columns
* Data wrangling: Data were grouped using .groupby to create sub-tables
* Exploratory Data Analysis: This was also carried out to determine trends and patterns in data

The chart shows sales increase in 2013 and 2014. With this analysis, sales is expected to increase

According to US Superstore's buying behaviour, demographics, and history, consumers are its main customers. In order, the West, East, Central, and South have the most sales. Office supplies are the top sold product category, followed by furniture and technology for all customer categories. Only Consumer purchases utilise First Class shipping, while all other transactions use standard. Finally, Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office consumers seldom use same-day delivery.

Technology is the most lucrative goods category. West and Consumers are the most lucrative regions and consumer segments, respectively.

The number of sales surge at the end of each year, particularly in November and December.

Late time_to_ship goods were mostly 'Office supplies' and that the delivery method was mainly 'Standard shipping'


## challenges faced

All challenges faced happened because I'm a data science newbie. I had challenges changing object datatype to datetime datatype, and I still do not know how to handle outliers
